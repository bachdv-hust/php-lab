    Dear Sirs,
    <p class="body">
    I am writing to inform you that, due to financial difficulties, I will be unable to pay my taxes this year. </p>

    <p class="body">
    You see, my company has had reduced profits this year. In fact gross revenues have now dropped below the GDp of <b>twelve</b> foreign countries! Given this intolerable situation, I am sure you will understand.</p>

    <h2 align="center">
    The 23rd psalm (King James Version)</h2>

    <span>T</span>he LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
    <p> He made me to lie down in green pastures: he led me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. </p>

    Sincerely,<br>
